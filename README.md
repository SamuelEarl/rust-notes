# Rust Notes

The markdown files in the `notes` were recorded as I read through [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) book.

The files inside `the_rust_programming_language/src/bin` directory contain some of the examples from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) book as I learned Rust.
