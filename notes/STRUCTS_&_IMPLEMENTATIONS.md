# Structs & Implementations (impl)

* Structs are like JavaScript objects with only data properties (no methods).
* Implementations are like the methods of a JavaScript object.
* JavaScript is kind of strange in the sense that you can create an object with properties and methods, but there no great way to separate concerns and keep everything organized. However, Rust seems to combine the concepts that JavaScript object provide, but in a more structured way.
* It is recommended to use structs when you are working with a data structure that has more than 2 or 3 fields because structs have named values (as opposed to tuples), which can help you keep your code organized.
